# Basic Memory De/Allocation

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// static
int var = 80;

int main() {

    // dynamic
    int *x = malloc(sizeof(int));           // give me space for one int
    int *arr = malloc(sizeof(int)*100);     // give me space for 100 int

    *x = 120;

    // OUT OF BOUNDS. This is bad arr[101] = 8;


    free(x);        // I don't want this memory anymore;
    free(arr);      // I don't want this memory anymore;
    x = NULL;
    arr = NULL;

    double *darr;
    darr = calloc(sizeof(double), 100);     // is the same as -- darr = malloc(sizeof(double)*100);
                                            // and also sets the bits to zero, which is helpful in
                                            // debugging

    darr = realloc(darr, sizeof(double)*500);       // increase the size of darr to include more data
                                                    // initial : 100
                                                    // now : 500
                                                    // realloc can be used to make blocks bigger or smaller
    darr = realloc(darr, sizeof(double)*100);       // Just remember that the address that realloc return
                                                    // could be different from the original pointer from the
                                                    // pointer to the original block and this means is there
                                                    // wasn't room for the new block and so it had to move it
                                                    // and of course it will copy the old contents to the new
                                                    // location so keep this in mind if you ever have pointers
                                                    // pointing to that original block and then you reallocate
                                                    // accessing those old copires could crash your program.
                                                    // So, we careful make sure that copies will get updated
                                                    // when you can realloc.
