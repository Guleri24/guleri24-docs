# Logistics Regression
goal: Find cats in images {A -> presence of a cat  
                          {O -> absence of a cat
3D image : 64 x 64 x 3

                        flatening 
                        the image

w - weights
b - baises

Steps:
1. Initalize w, b
2. Find the optimal w, b means defininy your loss function
3. Use them to predict 

```Eq 1: Neuron = Linear + Activation```
```Eq 2: Model = Architecture + Parameters```
