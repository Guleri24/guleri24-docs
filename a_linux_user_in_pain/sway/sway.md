# SwayWM - A tiling window manager
Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement for the 
i3 window manager for X11. It works with your existing i3 configuration
and supports most of i3's features, plus a few extras.

Sway allows you to arrange your application windows logically, rather 
than spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default which maximizes
the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly manipulated using only the
keyboard. 

The reason I'm using sway because build from scratch for wayland and low memory
consumption. 
And it sounds great "Sway" ;-)

The things to keep in mind while using sway that there is a slight learning 
curve. Before completly going to `sway`, I was using GNOME 40 in fedora.
While I was enjoying the best in class gestures in GNOME 40 but I was not satisfied.
I don't know how to explain it in word but it feels like something is missing.
So, I decided its the time to shift to Sway. I thought about it when I was using VIM.
I never considered VIM for a long time but one day I decided to use it. Gg Bois, when I 
started using it, its like a game changer.

Simply I aim is always to go for the tougher things because from them you learn a lot.

I also tried installing Gentoo ^-^.
