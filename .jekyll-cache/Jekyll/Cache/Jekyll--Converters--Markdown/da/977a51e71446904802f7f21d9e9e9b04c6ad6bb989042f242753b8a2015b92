<h1 id="swaywm---a-tiling-window-manager">SwayWM - A tiling window manager</h1>
<p>Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement for the 
i3 window manager for X11. It works with your existing i3 configuration
and supports most of i3‚Äôs features, plus a few extras.</p>

<p>Sway allows you to arrange your application windows logically, rather 
than spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default which maximizes
the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly manipulated using only the
keyboard.</p>

<p>The reason I‚Äôm using sway because build from scratch for wayland and low memory
consumption. 
And it sounds great ‚ÄúSway‚Äù ;-)</p>

<p>The things to keep in mind while using sway that there is a slight learning 
curve. Before completly going to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sway</code>, I was using GNOME 40 in fedora.
While I was enjoying the best in class gestures in GNOME 40 but I was not satisfied.
I don‚Äôt know how to explain it in word but it feels like something is missing.
So, I decided its the time to shift to Sway. I thought about it when I was using VIM.
I never considered VIM for a long time but one day I decided to use it. Gg Bois, when I 
started using it, its like a game changer.</p>

<p>Simply I aim is always to go for the tougher things because from them you learn a lot.</p>

<p>I also tried installing Gentoo ^-^.</p>
