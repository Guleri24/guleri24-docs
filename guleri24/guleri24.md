# Abhishek Guleri

I'm a Developer who focuses on exploring new things.
Just a random thing about me, I tried a lot of OS (especially GNU/Linux and BSDs).
After trying a lost (distro hopping ;-)  example: Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, FreeBSD, and many more) I understand the stability, and rolling release is the thing I want. OpenSUSE is the way to go.

The thing which drives me every day to open up my laptop is to see how the world is progressing and how I will be a part of it.

I believe that when a different group of people comes together, they can achieve something great.
As for the experience, I'm part of various societies, clubs, and groups in my institute, where we work together as a team to achieve the desired goals. 
When it comes to programming, readability and maintainability is the main thing I focus on because you are not writing for yourself (as life can have many turns) but for others.
